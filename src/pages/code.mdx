There's a picture of two-year-old me standing on my dad's desk, his arm around me as he used his [computer](temp) and I observed intently.

Nearly every week of my childhood, I visited that office at the local state [university](temp). By the time I was ten, I'd gotten my hands on (and probably destroyed) dozens of floppy disks.

I missed MySpace's heyday, but I got my first taste of HTML on <a class="external" href="https://www.kidzworld.com/" target="_blank">Kidzworld</a> and <a class="external" href="http://www.foopets.com/" target="_blank">Foopets</a>—social networks I stumbled upon during my unrestrained [explorations](temp) of the Internet.

On my profiles, I learned to add splashes of <span style="background: cyan">color</span>, make <b>bold</b> moves, and use

<center><p>lots</p></center>

<center><p>and lots of</p></center>

In middle school, I graduated to <a class="external" href="https://radiantxrad.tumblr.com" target="_blank">Tumblr</a>. My Hunger Games fandom blog evolved to include Percy Jackson, Harry Potter, social justice posts, and memes tastefully scattered across the cringe and shitpost scales. I documented my aspirations of [polyglottery](temp) with a langblr, and self-improvement efforts with a studyblr and fitblr.

At the same time, my ability to customize my corner of the Internet dramatically increased. I could choose a different blog theme from Tumblr's large collection... I could use a fellow user's creation... I could peek under the hood at the theme's code... I could change `margin-left: 60px;` to `margin-left: 0px;`, hit `Ctrl+S`, and see what happened...

...and repeat until I became fluent in CSS and HTML.

Driven by the desire to have fine-tuned control over how I expressed myself online, I learned the tool needed to do that—[learned by doing](temp).

To do: Improve ending, but how? Expand on the "lesson", add examples of early websites I made, hint at what came "next" in my coding career?
