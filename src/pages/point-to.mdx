# point to

I have a book sitting on my desk called *How to Win at College*—a title I would scoff at were I not already a fan of the <a class="external" href="https://calnewport.com" target="_blank">author</a>'s work. It contains a list of concise, actionable, and—in my opinion—smart tips on how to stand out without being (too) stressed out.

One tip reads, "Do one thing better than anyone else you know." Whether it's baking cupcakes, playing a particular video game, or solving riddles, mastering a skill—no matter how trivial—gives you confidence. When everything else is uncertain, you at least have "one thing to feel sure of."

It got me thinking. In my life, there are people I point to for being remarkable at something—so good that it's part of their identity, in a good way.

My <a class="external" href="https://thesephist.surge.sh" target="_blank">Linus</a>, who I met through [Hack Club](/communities), is prolific across a mindboggling number of fields. I lived with him last summer, and amid his mystifying schedule of eating one meal a day and sleeping ?? hours a day, he built a programming language and made a piano improv video on top of his internship and work for student organizations like Cal Hacks and Dorm Room Fund.

Another friend, <a class="external" href="https://lachlanjc.me" target="_blank">Lachlan</a> consistently creates websites and other projects that are high-quality and impactful. They're super opinionated about the tools they use and are always making <a class="external" href="https://notebook.lachlanjc.me/2019-09-24_lachlan_ultra/" target="_blank">big statements</a>, often while wearing their signature bright red jeans.

I know others who offer a helping hand (and foot) in any situation, who brighten every moment with humor, or who are fearless activists despite controversy and [criticism](/leadership).

I wonder: Who points to me, and what for? In others' lives, what am I (perceived as) (one of) the best at?

Some possibilities:
* Doing pistol squats
* Documenting my [failures](/fail)
* Hitting inbox zero
* [Making websites](/code)
