# point to

I have a book sitting on my desk called *How to Win at College*—a title I would scoff at were I not already a fan of the [author](https://calnewport.com)'s work. It contains a list of concise, actionable, and—in my opinion—smart tips on how to stand out without being (too) stressed out.

One tip reads, "Do one thing better than anyone else you know." Whether it's baking cupcakes, playing a particular video game, or solving riddles, mastering a skill—no matter how trivial—gives you confidence. When everything else is uncertain, you at least have "one thing to feel sure of."

It got me thinking. In my life, there are people I point to for being remarkable at something—so good that it's part of their identity, in a good way.

[Linus](https://thesephist.surge.sh) is prolific across a mindboggling number of fields—software engineering, venture capital, marketing, design.

[Lachlan](https://lachlanjc.me) consistently creates websites, projects, and pieces of art that are high-quality and impactful. They're intentional about the tools they use and are always making [big statements](https://notebook.lachlanjc.me/2019-09-24_lachlan_ultra/).

I know others who offer their help in any situation, who brighten every moment with their lighthearted attitude, or who are fearless in their activism despite controversy.

I wonder: Who points to me, and what for? What am I (perceived as) (one of) the best at?

Some possibilities:
* Doing pistol squats
* Hitting inbox zero
* [Making websites](code)
