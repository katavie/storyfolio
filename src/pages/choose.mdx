When I was eleven, I was at church one evening for a scouts program. (I would soon realize that I didn't really believe in God, but that's beside the point.) The pastor, with a friendly smile, asked me, "Are you a math and science person or a history and English person?"

I didn’t know how to answer. I was doing equally well in all my subjects at school, and I was learning both [Greek](languages) and [HTML](code)—a human language and computer language—on my own time. Though the question was merely small talk, it stuck with me. Could I be both? Neither?

In 10th grade, I did a research project about botulinum neurotoxin, which is both the world's most poisonous poison (by median lethal dose—1 nanogram per kilogram of body mass can kill someone) *and* the active ingredient in Botox.

While explaining my findings to visitors at science fairs, I realized that I enjoyed translating science ~~more than~~ as much as I enjoyed doing it. There was nothing like the grin of understanding that appeared on the face of a little 5-year-old who had come to listen. I saw the same look in others who stopped by.

I pieced together the mechanism of this poison into something a 15-year-old with little neuroscience background—me—could understand, *and* I managed to make it matter to others.

I vaguely knew that there were people who did this type of stuff professionally. After all, *someone* had to write *The New York Times's* science articles, the pamphlets at the doctor's office, and Khan Academy videos.

But as I looked into it more online, I discovered that there are people who produce documentaries that explore nature, technology, and society; who curate space artifacts and alchemy instruments; and who turn research into policy.

I didn't find all of them interesting, but this definitely didn't fall into the picture of what I thought science was.

Could this be the answer?

<p style="position: absolute; text-transform: uppercase; margin-left: -12rem; margin-top: 0; width: 10rem;text-align: right">Problem Statement</p>

The thing about science communication is that if you're a high schooler who wants to learn more about it, doing so (usually) isn't as easy as joining the soccer team or debate club. It's not really A Thing™ in schools.

There's <abbr title="science, technology, engineering, art, and math">STEAM</abbr>, and I'm probably biased, but it seems that these collaborations are mostly superficial and fail to do justice to both STEM and art.

There are exceptions: places and people that get real synergy from art and science—the Broad Institute wouldn't be the same without its artists-in-residence, and I've had the pleasure of meeting <a class="external" href="https://reyhanehmaktoufi.wordpress.com/">Reyhaneh Matoukfi</a> and <a class="external" href="https://matteofarinella.com/">Matteo Farinella</a>, who both make illustrations about life in science and doing science for people.

But for the most part, it feels like a trend full of well-intentioned but shallow efforts.

There's science communication in the form I wanted to pursue, but for different audiences. <a class="external" href="https://comscicon.com/">ComSciCon</a> has workshops across the country for and by graduate students who lead science communication initiatives. <a class="external" href="https://www.storycollider.org/">The Story Collider</a> has over 50 events per year for people to share evocative stories of how science has impacted them.

But the closest other science communication organization that I’ve found for high schoolers is run by a <a class="external" href="https://www.geneiusday.org/science-communication-summer-program">university in Hawaii</a>.

In my experience as a high schooler, science communication was not accessible to me. So I decided to seek my own solution and start an organization called Science and Us. I don’t want other students to face those same obstacles: not knowing what science communication is, and not knowing how to get started with it.

<p style="position: absolute; text-transform: uppercase; margin-left: -12rem; margin-top: 0; width: 10rem; text-align: right">Methods</p>

I gathered a small team of high schoolers from surrounding schools. In a year and a half, we’ve held three events at local universities for over 100 middle and high school students. We’ve had dozens of invited guests, who illustrate science comics, preserve artifacts from outer space missions, and produce podcasts about technology and the future. We’ve shared our ideas with and learned from other science communicators at conferences nationwide.

With my organization Science and Us, my goal is to change that, and we started by hosting events. At our first event, I remember meeting an eighth grader whose parents had made her come. She was a self proclaimed theatre and art kid, ready to have a really boring day at Science and Us. But she became intrigued when a presenter began talking about using Twitter to communicate her research.

<p style="position: absolute; text-transform: uppercase; margin-left: -12rem; margin-top: 0; width: 10rem; text-align: right">Results</p>

By the end of the day, this eighth grader excitedly applied to join our organizing team and is now our youngest member. A few months later, she voluntarily went to a talk about the science of happiness, which sparked a new interest in neuroscience for her.

The other day, I asked her, “Is neuroscience something you would’ve been interested in before Science and Us?” Her response was, “No way, Jose! Science scared me.” She still loves theatre and art, but has realized that she doesn’t have to choose a side - she can do both.

<p style="position: absolute; text-transform: uppercase; margin-left: -12rem; margin-top: 0; width: 10rem; text-align: right">Discussion</p>

What I see as the successful part of this story isn’t that science has gained another person, but rather that, for my friend, these fields are no longer closed off. Both art and science are equally valid parts of her identity, and she now feels comfortable embracing that.

Science and Us is not trying to promote what many people refer to as STEAM: science, technology, engineering, art, and math. Instead, I want to take a step beyond that. Instead of crossing the boundaries that divide fields, I want to eliminate those boundaries.

I want to live in a world where we don’t feel pressured to fit into a box labeled “science person” or “humanities person.”

I’m concerned that as we hyper-focus on pushing students into STEM fields, we forget about teaching and practicing science communication.

<p style="position: absolute; text-transform: uppercase; margin-left: -12rem; margin-top: 0; width: 10rem; text-align: right">Conclusion</p>

When you communicate a science topic, you’re approaching, breaking down, and explaining a complicated topic. These tools are not exclusive to science, and they help people define and solve problems using varying perspectives and a shared language.

Now more than ever, we need young people with a rich array of perspectives and the ability to share ideas clearly. And this I believe will help us to solve society’s biggest problems.
