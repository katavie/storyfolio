# storyfolio

Learning from the [people](communities) I work with and turning ideas into tangible [projects](mahacks) is central of what <a class="external" href="https://katmh.com">I</a> do.

But often the world only sees the results, not the processes of [learning](temp) and growth. We celebrate or [criticize](temp) where people have gotten, with little knowledge of how they got there.

What if we [chose](choose) to share the stories behind the outcomes more often?
