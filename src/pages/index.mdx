**What is this? And why did I make it?**

Something I've been grappling with lately is that I don't feel proud of most of my projects from high school.

If it's a research project, I didn't produce papers [worthy](worthy) of [Real Scientific Journals](jei). If it's [design](MAHacks), it's not professional enough. If it's an app, it's not [technically challenging](messagemake) enoughâ€”or maybe not even functional.

I felt like I had nothing I could [point to](point-to) and proudly explain, even though I can put plenty of those projects on my [resume](resume).

But in what ways can projects be valuable?

Here's an idea that I'm exploring: My experiences building these projects, working on [teams](teams) and in [communities](hack-club), and just *trying* are valid regardless of the quality of the outcomes.

And that's what [this](/) aims to show.
