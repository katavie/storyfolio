# 17th birthday (1/20/18)

**What are your long range goals?**

When I was thirteen years old, I defined my life’s purpose on a Google Docs file. Though now I would certainly select a more sophisticated typeface than Comfortaa, the words—carefully chosen and characteristically concise—were packed with a meaning and backed by a mindset that still profoundly resonate with me.

My interests have shifted time and time again as I’ve discovered new ideas. In the document, I tried to identify and define my underlying principles and values—a big picture to unify the details. At thirteen, I figured that many misunderstandings and disagreements occur when nuances in meaning are lost in translation. I wanted to ultimately improve global communication through smarter natural language processing technology and a philosophy of culturally-aware interface design.

My goal now is to conduct, communicate, and apply beneficial research. In both cases, the driving force has been to develop skills and use them to positively impact the world. Regardless of the specifics, however, the first step is educating myself so that my knowledge and expertise can make a truly substantial impact.

During college, I plan on majoring in a scientific field and eagerly pursuing research, extracurricular activities, and other opportunities available to me. I will likely continue onto graduate school to gain and contribute to knowledge in a specific discipline. After that, I might become a researcher in academia or industry, but I’m also considering pursuing entrepreneurial ventures based on breakthroughs in biotechnology and engineering.

Overall, I’m flexible about my long-range plans. I’m constantly engaged in one project or another, delving into questions that excite me. Because I don’t always have access to a laboratory, much of it is computational and often independent, but this has not restricted my curiosity. Exposing myself to diverse disciplines, from genetics to solid-state physics to digital humanities, enables me to gain more comprehensive and creative perspectives on the problems that plague the world. Science holds tremendous potential for advancing society, but I firmly believe that research in isolation is not sufficient.

Basic biological findings means little to the vast majority of people if they are not translated into effective and accessible medicine. Advancements in physics and engineering can provide valuable solutions to pressing issues, particularly concerning energy and our other limited resources. Additionally, it is essential to communicate complex scientific breakthroughs to policymakers and the public. Such knowledge is inextricably intertwined with our lives.

Science journalism weaves hard facts with the allure of human emotion and narrative, while generally avoiding being overly sensational. Developments in web-based technologies, as well as their increasingly widespread and pervasive accessibility, have led to an interest in creating interactive visualizations and other representations of scientific information. Innovative reporters are already starting to do this in their articles, but those remain seen by only the small part of the population that actively seeks it out.

Scientific and numerical literacy has been a major concern especially in the United States, among children and adult citizens alike. For the former, there has never been a better time to learn how to construct mental models of natural phenomena and approach problems logically and creatively. For the latter, understanding of science informs wiser decisions and opinions in a democratic society. There is a need for change in the way science as a philosophy is perceived and taught, and I would like that to be part of my long-range involvements. Regardless of my job title, therefore, I aspire to maintain a balance between making discoveries and explaining how they can impact us, our communities, and our world.
