# fail

More than a year ago, I made a resume of [all](/all) my most significant failures.

For over half a year, I’ve kept a public <a class="external" href="https://katmh.com/fail">page of failures on my website</a>, updating it pretty much every time a rejection notification or letter lands in my inbox—or in some cases, when I don’t hear anything back, indicating that I’ve been Ghosted™.

I’ve also added an FAQ section introducing what the concept is, why I made it, does it make me feel bad about myself, and a response to something I sometimes hear, which is that some of them don’t sound like failures. 

Interestingly, despite receiving little effort from me and being in a constant state of “under construction” and “[insert feature] coming soon,” this failure resume has gotten traction and attention.

<p><a class="external" href="https://devanpatel.co/">Devan</a> featured it in an <a class="external" href="https://testingarticles.carrd.co/#text08">article</a> about how to stand out. <a class="external" href="https://shamdasani.org/">Samay</a>, an acquaintance from <a href="/communities">Hack Club</a>, featured it a <a class="external" href="https://networking.shamdasani.org/">presentation</a> he gave at his college about building your personal brand. Surprisingly, several people have said that it’s funny—I only sort of understand why.</p>

I think it has reached the point where I do need to give it some more attention. In particular I think instead of creating a laundry list of every rejection, big or small, I’ve received, I should highlight the ones where [I learned](/leadership) the most and share the reflections and lessons.
