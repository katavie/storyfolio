Our newest team member, <a class="external" href="https://tmb.sh" target="_blank">Theo</a>, presented us with Hack Club Bank—a service he had found online, which would allow our [hackathon](mahacks) to raise money in a much less sketchy way than previously.

We could send invoices, view all our finances in a dashboard, and have a tax-exempt [nonprofit](start) status!

Along with this fiscal sponsorship tool for students, Hack Club also had an online community of club [leaders](temp) and members from across the world.

A few weeks ago, I was in the car with <a class="external" href="https://lachlanjc.me" target="_blank">Lachlan</a>, a former club leader from Pennsylvania, now attending NYU, and two Hack Club staff members—Chris, who's more permanently based in Connecticut, and Max, who's impermanently based in Connecticut.

We had just finished volunteering at a high school hackathon on Long Island. As we drove to a train station in the Bronx, we had tired musings about how to build the community.

It's interesting to think about building a place on the Internet where impressionable pre-teens are 

They want to build a nice place to be and grow up on the Internet. It often involves educating people to cultural sensitivity and social issues. How do you foster emotional maturation and cultural competence at scale?

Additionally, it is a community of young people and has already seen several generations of people enter and leave. This adds another dimension to the already complex issue. How do you establish and maintain a culture with people flowing in and out?
